Title: Stained Memories

[Verse 1]
Walking down the street, feeling fine
Until a splash of wine brings back a sign
Of a love that was once so sweet
But turned bitter, now memories repeat

[Chorus]
Stained memories, they won't fade away
Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
But now it's time to let it go

[Verse 2]
We started off so strong, love in bloom
But slowly it all came crashing down, impending doom
Words turned into weapons, hearts left scarred
Now just a stain on my shirt, a reminder so hard

[Chorus]
Stained memories, they won't fade away
Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
But now it's time to let it go

[Bridge]
I try to wash away the stain
But the memories still remain
I'll learn to move on, find a new start
And let go of the pain that's torn me apart

[Chorus]
Stained memories, they won't fade away
Like the wine on my shirt, they're here to stay
A rollercoaster of emotions, highs and lows
But now it's time to let it go

[Outro]
I'll wear this stain as a badge of strength
A reminder of what I've overcome at length
I'll move forward, leaving the past behind
Stained memories, but a new chapter in my mind.
